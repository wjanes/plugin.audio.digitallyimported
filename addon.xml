        <description lang="en_GB">DI.FM (also known as Digitally Imported) is an Internet radio broadcaster consisting
            of over 90 channels dedicated exclusively to electronic music, such as house, trance, techno, drum and bass,
            and dubstep. DI.FM broadcasts handpicked selections consisting of classic, new and up-and-coming hits,
            as well as weekly and monthly mixed shows from professional DJs. It was founded in December 1999 as a
            hobby project by Ari Shohat in his Binghamton University dorm room and was one of the first
            Internet radio stations. It has often been listed as one of the top internet radio stations.</description>
