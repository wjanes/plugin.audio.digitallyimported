It’s no surprise then that Deep House was also born there as pioneering House artists in the 1980s began spinning sounds that combined the best of electronic House music with elements of funk, soul, and jazz for Chicago’s unique smaller and mid-sized clubs. The DI.FM Deep House channel brings together a remarkable collection of the best Deep House music in the world with silky acoustic tracks, probing baselines, and the occasional layer of soulful vocals. Standout artists on the channel include Miguel Migs, Fred Everything, Kerri Chandler, Sebb Junior, Saison, Art of Tones, and many more. Be sure to check out the channel’s excellent selection of mix shows, some of which are exclusive and first-to-air content only found on DI.FM."
